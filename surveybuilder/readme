The SurveyBuilder application is a survey management system (similar to SurveyMonkey) implemented in Links programming language. It consists of 4 modules:
- "SurveyGenerator". Module where the new surveys are emerging.
- "SurveyFiller". Module sent to potential respondents where they fill out the surveys.
- "SurveyResultsAnalizer". Module displaying all the answers the respondents gave to the questions contained in the surveys.
- "SingleSurveyEditor". Module sent to the respondent who wants to edit the answers he/she has already given.

The application has been developed by Piotr Hajduk during the summer internship in 2015 at the University of Edinburgh. The project has been supervised by: James Cheney, Sam Lindley and Garrett Morris.
